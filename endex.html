            <p>JavaScript is a versatile and dynamic programming language widely used for creating interactive elements
                on websites. With its ability to add functionality like form validation and animations, JavaScript plays
                a crucial role in enhancing user experience.</p>
            <p>
                This documentation introduces JavaScript's key features, its history, compatibility with web browsers,
                and its significance in modern web development for creating dynamic and engaging web pages.

                JavaScript, a dynamic programming language, is essential for creating interactive elements on websites.
                Its features, such as form validation and animations, enhance user experience. This documentation
                introduces JavaScript's history, compatibility with web browsers, and its pivotal role in modern web
                development for crafting engaging web pages.

                <li><span class="bold">Variables: </span> In JavaScript, variables are used to store data values. They
                    can be declared using the var, let, or const keywords.</li>

                <li><span class="bold">Data Types: </span>
                    JavaScript supports various data types such as numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, objects, and
                    more.

                <li><span class="bold">Conditional statements: </span>
                    JavaScript uses if, else if, and else statements to make decisions based on different conditions.

                <li><span class="bold">Loops: </span>
                    JavaScript provides for loops, while loops, and do...while loops to iterate through code blocks

                <li><span class="bold" >Events: </span>
                    JavaScript can respond to user actions like clicks, mouse movements, and keyboard inputs through

            <header>Js and Java</header>
            <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript
                language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript
                follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the
                reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
            <p>
                In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a
                runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.
                JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The
                prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual
                objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can
                be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
            </p>

            <p>
                JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables,
                classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
                protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types
                are not explicitly typed.

        <section id="helloWorld" class="main-section">
            <header>Printing Hello world in Java</header>
            <p>Here is an example of a "Hello World" program in JavaScript:</p>
            <code>console.log("Hello, World!");</code>
            <p>
                In this example, the JavaScript code within the tags uses console.log() to output the message "Hello,
                World!" to the console. When you run this code in a browser, you should see the message displayed in the
                console.
            </p>
            <p>Greeting someone.</p>
            <code>
                function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
greetMe("World");
            </code>
            <p>In yourName place, enter your name and run the program.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="variable" class="main-section">
            <header>Variables</header>
            <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called
                identifiers, conform to certain rules.
            </p>

            <p> A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent
                characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the
                characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
            </p>

            <code>String name = "Bruce Wang";</code>
            <p>This creates a simple string data type variable.</p>

            <p> You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode
                escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and
                _name.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="ifelse_statement" class="main-section">
            <header>if..else Statement</header>
            <p>Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional else clause
                to execute a statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:</p>
            <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>

            <p>condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See Boolean for an explanation of what
                evaluates to true and false. If condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise,
                statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement, including further nested if
                statements.</p>

            <p>
                You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple conditions tested in sequence, as
                follows:
            </p>
            <code>
                if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) {
                    statement_2; } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else {
                    statement_last; }
            </code>
            <p>It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression, because the assignment can be
                confused with equality when glancing over the code.</p>
